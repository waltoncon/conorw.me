Doclet is an offline-first documentation browser that aggregates developer resources from multiple sources, including web frameworks, package libraries (Cargo crates, npm packages), MAN pages, software manuals (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and MDN docs. Users can install the documentation they need for offline access, making it ideal for low-connectivity environments.

It is still in early development, but planned features include global search, automatic updates, cross-platform desktop and mobile apps, and potential AI-assisted querying.
