This project draws inspiration from modular card systems like [Everdeck](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291951/the-everdeck) and [Singularity Deck](https://www.singularity.games/singularity-deck), which reimagine traditional playing cards to maximize their versatility. By incorporating elements from these systems and expanding to eight suits across two French-suited decks, the goal is to create a flexible toolkit for a wide variety of games. In addition to traditional card games, it supports modern titles like Coup, Take 5, Werewolf, Love Letter, Virus, Skull, The Mind and more.

The website serves primarily as a showcase for the cards and also as a reference for the games they support. While only a few games have been added so far, the long-term vision is to grow this collection into a flexible toolkit for players looking to explore new game mechanics with a single deck.
